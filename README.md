## Setup
1. Install `npm`, `grunt`, and `bower` (or run `./installDependencies`)
4. run `npm install` and `bower install` to gather dependencies
5. Run `grunt watch`, or just `grunt` because that maps to `watch`.
6. Edit your files while grunt watches

## Creating production
1. run `grunt prod`
2. You will now see a prod folder that contains all the data you need for the server. You can put this folder where ever it needs to go to be run

NOTE: To create dev, run `grunt dev`

## Run Server on  Mac
1. Download MAMP
